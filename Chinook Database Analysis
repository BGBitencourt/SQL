## In This file I analyze the Chinook Database with 11 tables relating to one another. 

-- 1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

-- 2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country LIKE 'Bra%';

--3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName || ' ' || cust.LastName AS FullName, inv.InvoiceID, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerID
WHERE cust.Country = 'Brazil';

-- 4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title LIKE '%Sales%Agent%';

-- 5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

-- 6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.FirstName || ' ' || emp.LastName AS SalesAgentsName, inv.InvoiceID
FROM chinook.employees emp
    JOIN chinook.customers cust 
    ON emp.EmployeeID = cust.SupportRepID
        JOIN chinook.invoices inv
        ON cust.CustomerID = inv.CustomerID
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
ORDER BY SalesAgentsName, inv.InvoiceId;

-- 7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT cust.FirstName ||  ' ' || cust.LastName AS CustomersName, 
inv.Total, cust.Country, 
emp.FirstName || ' ' || emp.LastName AS SalesAgentsName

-- 9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total) AS TotalSales2009
FROM chinook.invoices
