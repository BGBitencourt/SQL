-- In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-- 1. How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
SELECT Count (Distinct orderid)

WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(Distinct orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb 
INNER JOIN  BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min (price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT JanSales.Product, ROUND((SUM(Quantity)*Price),2) Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product,

location,

-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
