# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- 1. What are the top 5 most popular artists?
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY (popularity)
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 2. What are the most dancible songs and in what key are they in?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability, song_key, energy
FROM Bit_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC;

-- 3. Give me the average energy for the top 5 most dancible songs
SELECT avg(energy)
FROM (SELECT energy
    FROM Bit_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY danceability DESC 
    LIMIT 5);

-- 4. Give me the 5 most dancible songs with energy above the average
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability, song_key, energy
FROM Bit_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE energy > (SELECT AVG(energy) FROM Bit_DB.Spotifydata)
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- USING CTE
-- 5.Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH popularity_avg_CTE AS (
    SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity) AS avg_popularity
    FROM Spotifydata s
    GROUP BY s.artist_name)
    
SELECT artist_name, avg_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
